as a string with exactly two decimal places.

/* the $ is a shorthand for the jQuery object.

 utilities for working with HTML elements and events. 
When you see $ in jQuery code, it usually signifies that a jQuery operation is being performed. */

/* If you were working with HTML content that included tags (e.g., displaying formatted HTML text), 
then you might use .innerHTML to insert and render HTML tags within the element. 
However, in cases where you're dealing with plain text content updates, 
it's generally better to use .textContent to prevent any unintended rendering of HTML tags
 and potential security vulnerabilities */
